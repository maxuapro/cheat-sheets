npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux
@reduxjs/toolkit has redux itself inside, so no need to install redux
First we need a slice, which is a set of data we are gonna be storing and also set of methods we are gonna be manipulating our data with in our app. 
We can have multiple slices for different purposes.

Import createSlice function

import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const initialCounterState = { counter: 0, showCounter: true }
const sliceVariable = createSlice({
   name: 'counter', 
   initialState: initialCounterState,
   reducers: {
       increment(state) {
           state.counter++
       },
       decrement(state) {
           state.counter--
       },
       increase(state, action) {
           state.counter = state.counter + action.payload
       },
       toggle(state) {
           state.showCounter = !state.showCounter
       }
   }
})
export const counterActions = sliceVariable .actions
export default sliceVariable.reducer

here: name - IDK what's it for (look up here https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice)
initialCounterState - initial state (the state data)
reducers - set of methods, each of them takes State and Action. State is obvoius - goes into method BY DEFAULT! 
Doesn't need to be taken as a parameter when the method is called. Action - a parameter we are gonna be defining in Dispatch fuctions later in components
------------------------------------------
Next: create Store
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import sliceVariable from './counter'

const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        counter: sliceVariable ,
    }
})
export default store

----------------------------------------------------
Next: let's give access to the entire app our redux functionality:

In the index.js:

import store from './store/index_redux'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

ReactDOM.render(
   <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
   </Provider>,
   document.getElementById('root')
);
---------------------------------------------------------
Next: getting acces to the Store data and methods

import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'  // hooks
import { counterActions } from '../store/counter'

to get data:
const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter.counter)
const show = useSelector(state => state.counter.showCounter)

to change data:
const dispatch = useDispatch()

we can call our methods and alter the state by pushing counterActions.[method name]
***arguments that methods get as parameters are our Action parameter difined in cretaeSlice method earlier!

const increment = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.increment())
  }
const incrementByFive = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.increase(10))
  }
const decrement = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.decrement())
  }
const toggleCounterHandler = () => {
    dispatch(counterActions.toggle())
  }
